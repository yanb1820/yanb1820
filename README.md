# 👋 Hi, I'm Jiao Bao!


## 🙋🏻 About Me

I currently live in the USA 🇺🇸 (Eastern Standard Time 🕒) and I’m passionate about technology 🚀, coding 👨‍💻, and collaborating on innovative software, machine learning 🤖, and AI projects. I love connecting with the developer community 🌐👥. Outside of work and study, I enjoy playing games like Cyberpunk 🎮, exercising and lifting weights 🏋️, playing piano 🎹, and spending quality time with my family ❤️.


## 🔭 I'm currently working on 
### [Emotion Classification with DistilBERT (Ekman 7 Labels)](https://github.com/yanb1820/emotion_llm)

- 🔗 Connects **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with **Cognitive Science** by mapping emotions to Ekman’s basic emotion theory.
- 🎯 Builds **explainable AI** applicable to:
  - Chatbots
  - Social media analysis
  - Educational tools
- 🧪 Fine-tunes **DistilBERT** on the **GoEmotions** dataset.
- 🎭 Maps the 28 original GoEmotions labels to **6 Ekman emotions + neutral**.
